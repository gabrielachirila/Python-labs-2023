# 1.
# Create a Python script that does the following:
# Takes a directory path and a file extension as command line arguments (use sys.argv).
# Searches for all files with the given extension in the specified directory (use os module).
# For each file found, read its contents and print them.
# Implement exception handling for invalid directory paths, incorrect file extensions, and file access errors.
